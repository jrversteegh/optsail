OptSail
=======

Optsail is a collection of tools for sail routing.

Currently the following components are available:
 - Grib file reader and interpolator for wind and current data
 - Map/chart reader for determining shore lines
 - Polar performance evaluator

A (still incomplete) tool build on top of this can be found [here](http://sail.orca-st.com/)
